# odin-recipes

The goal of this project is to apply the fundamentals of HTML learned throughout the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations) course of
The Odin Project. A basic static website comprised only of HTML files containing recipes was built. The fundamental HTML
elements were utilized in order to display text, lists, images, and hyperlinks.

As an aside, this project served as a hands-on introduction to git, github, and maintaining a repository.
