                <li>A quarter of cup of parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for two minutes. Add the onions. 
            Cook five minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Add the ground lamb (or ground beef) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, 
            rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for six to eight minutes, until the meat is browned, 
            stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for one minute.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. 
            Simmer for five minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a 
            simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, ten to fifteen minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot 
            for a minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.
        </li>
        <li>Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients 
            are mixed together.
        </li>
        <li>Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 inch (or 23x23 centimeter) baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. 
            Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesnâ€™t bubble 
            over into your oven. Bake uncovered for twenty-five to thirty minutes. Cool for fifteen minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
