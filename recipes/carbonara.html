    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>One package of spaghetti (14 ounce)</li>
        <li>5 ounces of guanciale (cured pork cheek) cut into small cubes.
            As an alternative, bacon may be used
        </li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>One large egg</li>
        <li>Three quarters of a cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus whatever you may want to add 
            to your plate once served. As an alternative, Parmesan can be used
        </li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
            Stir in the spaghetti and lower the heat slightly. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until
            tender yet firm to the bite (time will vary based on brand of pasta). Reserve about a cup of pasta water
            and then drain.
        </li>
        <li>In the meantime, place a skillet over a hob at medium heat; add guanciale (or bacon), cook and stir until
            crisp, for 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk the 3 egg yolks and whole egg together in a bowl; add in the grated Pecorino Romano (or Parmesan)
            cheese, salt, and black pepper until it becomes a uniform mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti are done, add them to the skillet, together with a gentle amount of pasta water, and
            stir for a few seconds. Add in the contents of the bowl and continue to stir until a yellow cream coats
            all of the spaghetti.
        </li>
        <li>Serve, and then season to taste with extra cheese and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
